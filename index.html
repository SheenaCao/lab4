                Web standards play a significant role in the development of web pages because they present guidelines and rules that developers should follow, allowing uniformity, which is necessary for browsers and devices. The World Wide Web has led to the advancement of these standards over time, from simple text documents linked through basic tags to more complex technologies. <br><br>
                The fundamental advantage of following web standards is a stable and dependable website accessible to online users via several platforms. With the compliance of standards, websites developed maintain an appealing look for everyone using different browsers, creating a more inclusive environment and enjoyable experience that all can access comfortably (Strantz 290). Another benefit is that web standards help greatly decrease development time by creating a well-organized structure that allows code reuse and encourages effectiveness. When code is standardized, it becomes easier to correct bugs and issues since developers know what pattern the tested script should follow.<br><br>
                Additionally, following web standards improves SEO (search engine optimization). Search engines like Google prefer sites that use standard markup, making it easier to crawl and index the content. It implies that compliance with web standards can lead to enhanced ranking in search engine results pages, which is critical as most of the traffic on a website comes through search engines. <br><br>
                Also, conforming to web standards ensures compatibility across browsers. With so many different browsers around today, ensuring that the website stays uniform on all of them is difficult. Web standards come here since they provide a universal set of rules that all browsers should adhere to when rendering websites. It ensures that users feel the same way regardless of their browser. <br><br>
                Besides cross-browser compatibility, adherence to web standards ensures that people with special needs can access websites. According to the standards, there are guidelines on how websites can be designed in a way that makes them accessible, like adding alt texts for images or captions onto videos (Vollenwyder et al. 3). These guidelines help developers make sure their websites are accessible to all, including the visually impaired and other disabled people. Overall, compliance with these standards is important since it helps to build effective websites that equally operate on all devices.<br><br>

        <h2>Addendum: Explanation of Stylistic Choices</h2>
        <p>
            The decision to use 'Abril Fatface' for headings stems from its bold and expressive nature, which captures the reader's attention and conveys the significance of the article's subject. This typeface, with its substantial weight and distinctive presence, gives titles the necessary prominence. For body text, 'Roboto' was selected for its clean, modern appearance that promotes readability across various devices and screen sizes. It provides a comfortable reading experience without competing with the commanding headlines.

            A minimalist color palette has been employed to maintain a professional and crisp appearance. The choice of a dark grey hue over pure black for text mitigates the starkness while maintaining optimal contrast for readability. Subtle borders and understated background colors were utilized to delineate sections clearly without overpowering the content.
        </p>
        <p>
            A conventional two-column layout was implemented, reflecting the standard structure of print and digital news articles. This format supports a clear segregation of the main content from the supplementary information, facilitating an intuitive reading flow. The generous spacing between sections, as well as within the text, helps in reducing visual clutter, allowing readers to focus on the content without distractions.
        </p>
        <p>
            A clear hierarchy has been established through the use of varied font sizes and styles. This hierarchical structure guides the reader through the content, distinguishing between headings, subheadings, and body text. The headers are designed to stand out, while the body text remains understated yet legible, creating a balanced page layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adherence to web standards and accessibility guidelines was a paramount consideration in the design process. By following these standards, the webpage is not only compliant with legal requirements but also ensures that the content is accessible to a wider audience, including those with disabilities. Features such as increased line height for body text and appropriate font sizes contribute to the overall accessibility of the webpage.

            In summary, the stylistic choices made in the CSS are deliberate and purposeful, aimed at creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing news report that is accessible and engaging to all users.
