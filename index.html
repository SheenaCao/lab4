                Web standards play a significant role in the development of web pages because they present guidelines and rules that developers should follow, allowing uniformity, which is necessary for browsers and devices. The World Wide Web has led to the advancement of these standards over time, from simple text documents linked through basic tags to more complex technologies. <br><br>
                The fundamental advantage of following web standards is a stable and dependable website accessible to online users via several platforms. With the compliance of standards, websites developed maintain an appealing look for everyone using different browsers, creating a more inclusive environment and enjoyable experience that all can access comfortably (Strantz 290). Another benefit is that web standards help greatly decrease development time by creating a well-organized structure that allows code reuse and encourages effectiveness. When code is standardized, it becomes easier to correct bugs and issues since developers know what pattern the tested script should follow.<br><br>
                Additionally, following web standards improves SEO (search engine optimization). Search engines like Google prefer sites that use standard markup, making it easier to crawl and index the content. It implies that compliance with web standards can lead to enhanced ranking in search engine results pages, which is critical as most of the traffic on a website comes through search engines. <br><br>
                Also, conforming to web standards ensures compatibility across browsers. With so many different browsers around today, ensuring that the website stays uniform on all of them is difficult. Web standards come here since they provide a universal set of rules that all browsers should adhere to when rendering websites. It ensures that users feel the same way regardless of their browser. <br><br>
                Besides cross-browser compatibility, adherence to web standards ensures that people with special needs can access websites. According to the standards, there are guidelines on how websites can be designed in a way that makes them accessible, like adding alt texts for images or captions onto videos (Vollenwyder et al. 3). These guidelines help developers make sure their websites are accessible to all, including the visually impaired and other disabled people. Overall, compliance with these standards is important since it helps to build effective websites that equally operate on all devices.<br><br>
